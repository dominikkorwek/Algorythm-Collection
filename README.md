## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dominikkorwek/Algorythms.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the directory** where the algorithm you are interested in is located:

    ```bash
    cd Algorythms/<folder_name>
    ```

3. **Run the algorithm** using the appropriate compiler or interpreter for the programming language used. For example:

    ```bash
    python algorithm_name.py
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    gcc algorithm_name.c -o algorithm_name
    ./algorithm_name
    ```
