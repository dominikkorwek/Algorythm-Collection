# Algorithm Collection - Potyczki Algorytmistyczne 2024

This repository contains a collection of algorithmic challenges and solutions from the **Potyczki Algorytmistyczne 2024** competition, as well as implementations of basic algorithms and exercises related to iterators. The repository is designed to help you improve your algorithmic skills through practice and study.

## Contents

### 1. Potyczki Algorytmistyczne 2024
This section includes solutions to various problems from the **Potyczki Algorytmistyczne 2024** competition. The problems cover a wide range of algorithmic concepts. Each solution is implemented in Java and includes well-commented code to help you understand the approach and logic used.

### 2. Basic Algorithms
In this section, you'll find Java implementations of fundamental algorithms that are essential for any programmer:

- **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: Implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
- **Palindrome Check**: A function to determine whether a given string is a palindrome.
- **Exponentiation**: Efficient algorithms for exponentiation, including both iterative and recursive methods.
- **Factorial Calculation**: Functions to calculate the factorial of a number using both iterative and recursive approaches.

### 3. Iterator Exercises
This section contains a set of problems and solutions focused on the use of iterators in Java. The exercises are designed to enhance your understanding of how iterators work and how they can be applied in various algorithmic contexts.
